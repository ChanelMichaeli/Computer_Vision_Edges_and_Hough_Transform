# Computer_Vision_Edges_and_Hough_Transform
In this assignment, we will learn about edge detection and the hough transform. Although MATLAB
has many built-in functions, our goal is to learn image processing by doing things ourselves. Please
avoid using built-in MATLAB functions unless clearly stated otherwise.
