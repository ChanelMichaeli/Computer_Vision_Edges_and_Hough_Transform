# Computer_Vision_Edges_and_Hough_Transform
In this assignment, we will learn about edge detection and the hough transform. Although MATLAB
has many built-in functions, our goal is to learn image processing by doing things ourselves. Please
avoid using built-in MATLAB functions unless clearly stated otherwise.
The assignment requirements are described in the pdf file named Ex4. 
The MATLAB code file is named Ex4.m.
The final assignment report is described in the pdf file named NA-311394357_CM-208491787.
